# Five Mini Beginner Python Projects

I came across this [medium post](https://medium.com/learning-journalism-tech/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner-21492f6ce0f3) amidst my so many tabs. I thought I should try it out. 

Am no beginner, but then it still is interesting to write some code when am idle. So here goes. Feel free to fork, modify and make better. I don't think this is the best code I'll write for these projects.
